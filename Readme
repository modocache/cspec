= CSpec

BDD test framework for the C programming language.

* Coming Soon.

== TODO:

* fix nesting
* more matchers
* make install 
* prefix suite descriptions ... dont display unless it
  has specs. 

== Example

The following example uses the CSpec grammar, which is compiled to 
the literal C code below it.

  #include "cspec.h"

  static int nbefore_each;

  describe "CSpec before_each"
    before_each
      ++nbefore_each;
    end
    
    it "should be called before each spec"
      nbefore_each should equal 1
    end
    
    it "should be called before each spec"
     nbefore_each should equal 2
    end
  end

  ...
  
  #include "cspec.h"
  
  static int nbefore_each;
  
  void block_0_callback() {
    ++nbefore_each;
  }
  
  void block_1_callback() {
    expect((match_equal(nbefore_each,  1)));
  }
  
  void block_2_callback() {
    expect((match_equal(nbefore_each,  2)));
  }
  
  int main() {
    Suite *suite_0 = Suite_new("CSpec before_each");
    Block *block_0 = Block_new(blockTypeBeforeEach, NULL, &block_0_callback);
    Block *block_1 = Block_new(blockTypeSpec, "should be called before each spec", &block_1_callback);
    Block *block_2 = Block_new(blockTypeSpec, "should be called before each spec", &block_2_callback);
    Suite_push_block(suite_0, block_0);
    Suite_push_block(suite_0, block_1);
    Suite_push_block(suite_0, block_2);
    Suite_run(suite_0);
    return 0;
  }
